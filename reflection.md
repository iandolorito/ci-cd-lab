# Reflection

1. CI and CD 
CI (Continuous Integration) is about regularly merging code changes to the main branch and checking if everything works.  
CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) is about releasing those changes quickly and safely to users.

2. Importance of Automation
Automation saves time, reduces mistakes, and makes the process faster.

3. How CI/CD Helps 
It improves teamwork because everyoneâ€™s work gets tested and merged smoothly.  
It improves software quality because problems are found early.

4. Challenges Faced
I had trouble setting up the tools at first and understanding the steps, but I learned through trial and error although i followed the instructions clearly i faced some typo and etc.
